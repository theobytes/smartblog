title: Introduction to theory of computation
description: >-
  Theory of computation is the study of problems and how they can be solved
  efficiently on a model of computation using algorithms. It is branch of
  computer science and mathematics that studies the power and limits of
  computing machines.

This post seeks to introduce the reader to what theory of computation is all about and how computers can be better understood on a fundamental level.

Are there problems that a computing machine cannot solve?, no matter:

* The superiority of the algorithm
* The programming language used
* The hardware we use

If the problems exist, how do we identify them.

These questions are answered in theory of computation.

## Branches of Theory of Computation

1. **Complexity theory** - A theory of problem classification, the easy problems and the hard problems.
2. **Computability theory** - A theory on how to classify problems into intractable and tractable problems.
3. **Automata theory** - A theory that studies abstract computing machines, the definitions and attributes of different computation models.

   * Finite Automata - Are useful models used in different kinds of hardware and software.

     1. Software for regulating the behavior of circuits
     2. Lexical analyzer for compilers
     3. Text processors
   * Context Free Grammars - Models for defining programming languages.
   * Turing Machines - An abstract model of a computer e.g a PC.

## Application of Computation Theory

1. Pattern recognition in text i.e string searching algorithms.
2. Identifying tractable and intractable problems
3. Compiler design
4. Spell checkers
5. Evaluating arithmetic problems
6. Implementation of genetic programming
7. Implementation of neural networks
8. Implementation of robotics problems
