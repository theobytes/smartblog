Web development is funny, enjoyable and easy if you know what you're doing. Many young programmers, however, find it difficult to start developing web systems using serious frameworks. There are many web frameworks and they'll seem to work in the same way and that causes a lot of dilemmas as to which framework to pick and learn and use. This post will highlight the similarities, differences, advantages and disadvantages of using either Laravel or Django Web Framework.

Laravel and Django are the two most popular web frameworks and many website and systems use these frameworks to power their backend. One of the reasons why the frameworks gained much popularity is their inbuilt support for API development which will then communicate with Progressive Web Apps and Single Page Applications (React or Angular) frontends. Before we start let's define a framework.

## Web Framework

A web framework is abstract software. The framework has abstract implementations of functions such as routers, views, model development and migrations. These abstractions help a developer get started very quickly without deep programming knowledge.

### Django Web Framework

Django is a high-level web framework written purely in python programming language. It follows the MVT (Model View Template) framework. It encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Many of the features a programmer can hope for are inbuilt and easy to extend in your project. It is also free and open-source, meaning you can also contribute to the development of Django.

#### Features

Self-proclaimed features of Django web framework according to their website. These features however depends on your overall developing prowess. The overall performance  depends, in most cases, in how you know and use your python.

##### Fast

Django helps you transform your concepts and designs from paper to code to production in a very short space of time. 

##### **Secure**

Every web framework is built with security in mind. All the known vulnerabilities of websites are taken care of by the framework and so you don't need to worry about security as much as you would do if you develop the site yourself.

##### Scalability

A Django project comprises of applications (apps) and each of those apps is pluggable to the project. So you can develop your applications in part and then plug them at the end.
