title: What is cloud computing
description: >-
  Cloud computing is a new type of delivering computing resources. You pay for
  the services you want to use to a cloud provider and you connect to those
  services over a network.
---
Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over a network, the internet mostly. This enables small as well as big companies without a budget to spend on computing power to just borrow those computing services and utilize as if they own them. 

## Computing services

1. Servers
2. Storage
3. Networking
4. Databases
5. Analytics
6. Intelligence

### Cloud Servers

A cloud server is a virtual server, which runs in a cloud infrastructure.  You can borrow a virtual server and use it via a network(internet). There are many benefits of using virtual server over physical server,

* Stability, speed and security - Cloud hosting platform let many servers be involved in every client's task, this gives stability and speed to the services because the workload is distributed over several servers, joined in a cluster. Also worthy noting, all cloud hosting providers have special servers that handle the computing services separately e.g storage, databases ..... this gives stability and performance to the setup.
* Scalability - You can start with any servers you want and can upgrade to any size you want without the worry of configuring the servers,

  #### Cloud Hosting Providers

  1. [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
  2. [Linode](https://www.linode.com/)
  3. [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
  4. [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)



### Cloud Storage Service

Maintaining and managing customers data, delivering the data over the internet. The main benefit of using cloud storage lies in your ability to scale, manage and secure your storage anytime. Leading uses includes archiving, sharing, disaster recovery and also primary storage.

### Cloud Networking

All the networking functions are hosted in the cloud. Because the internet is so fast, there's no delay in delivering those services whenever needed. There is routing, switching and many other functions which can be centrally managed in a cloud environment.

### Cloud Analytics

Data mining is a computing power extensive process, without a proper computer with enough RAM, ROM and some special drivers one cannot fully enjoy analyzing data. So to democratize data mining, a solution to power consumption was needed badly. Cloud analytics is a service where one or more components of an analytics setup is hosted in the clouds. There are many separate components of analytics namely, data sets, data models, computing power and processing software, and each of these component services can be easily managed in the cloud. The are a variety of choices if you want to perform some data mining in the cloud.

#### Data analytics cloud platforms

1. [Big Data Analytics Solutions](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/big-data/)
2. [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/stream-analytics/)
3. [AWS analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/datalakes-and-analytics/)
4. [Zoho Analytics](https://www.zoho.com/reports/zohoreports-pricing.html)
5. [IBM Cognos Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/products/cognos-analytics)



## Benefits of Cloud Computing

1. ### **Cost**

   You don't need to buy hardware and running remote or on-site data centers. There's too much burden in running your own data center, the electricity, server, racks, cooling system and also the brainpower experts who do the everyday running of the servers. So cloud computing helps you achieve more without having to spend on infrastructure.
2. ### Performance

   Cloud computing services are distributed over a worldwide network of data centers. The workload and done by a server nearby. Cloud computing providers have major data centers in almost every continent and when you signup for the services you can choose a data center nearby to reduce latency. 
3. ### Speed

   A large amount of computing services (power) can be provisioned in seconds time and on demand. You don't have to plan on capacity and scale.
