title: What is cloud computing ?
description: >-
  Cloud computing is a new type of delivering computing resources. You pay for
  the services you want to use to a cloud provider and you connect to those
  services over a network.

Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services or resources over a network, the internet mostly. These services range from servers to networking functions.  A company can build its own cloud infrastructure or use the infrastructure of a paid provider such as Amazon AWS or Azure.

Cloud computing can generally be viewed as a data centers available to users over the internet.

## Types of  Cloud Deployment

There are three types of cloud service deployment, each categorized by who own the infrastructure, how you manage and secure your business data.

### Public Cloud

Services offered through the internet from a public cloud provider. The service provider incur the bandwidth and infrastructure costs. And it has very limited configurations disposable to the user. The cloud services are available to any organisation, on-demand. It is very cheap as compared to other cloud types, however. the public cloud is not suitable for organisations with very sensitive data as it is less secure and vulnerable to infiltration.

### Private Cloud

Businesses build and manage their own data centers for their specific tasks.There is more control over scalability, flexibility and customizability. A business can build the needed infrastructure or outsource it from other providers such as amazon aws, Microsoft azure and any more.

### Hybrid Cloud

The integration public cloud architecture and private architecture, taking the benefits of both architectures. Public clouds are cheap and offers benefits such as scalability and easy management, however, the public cloud architecture is not secure. As a result, it's not advisable to put high risk, sensitive data in it. 

On the other hand, private cloud infrastructure is secure and offers the user much greater customization power. However, it is very expensive to maintain a private cloud because of the equipment and expertise needed to run one. 

So, a business can decide to take the benefits of both private and public cloud, dividing the workload and services into two categories, high risk and less risk. The less risky data and services are deployed in the public cloud and the high risk and sensitive services are deployed to the private cloud.

## Computing Services

1. Servers
2. Storage
3. Networking
4. Databases
5. Analytics
6. Intelligence

### Cloud Servers

A cloud server is a virtual server, which runs in a cloud infrastructure.  You can borrow a virtual server and use it via a network(internet). There are many benefits of using virtual server over physical server,

* Stability, speed and security - Cloud hosting platform let many servers be involved in every client's task, this gives stability and speed to the services because the workload is distributed over several servers, joined in a cluster. Also worthy noting, all cloud hosting providers have special servers that handle the computing services separately e.g storage, databases ..... this gives stability and performance to the setup.
* Scalability - You can start with any servers you want and can upgrade to any size you want without the worry of configuring the servers,

  3. [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
  4. [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

### Cloud Storage Service

Maintaining and managing customers data, delivering the data over the internet. The main benefit of using cloud storage lies in your ability to scale, manage and secure your storage anytime. Leading uses includes archiving, sharing, disaster recovery and also primary storage.

### Cloud Networking

All the networking functions are hosted in the cloud. Because the internet is so fast, there's no delay in delivering those services whenever needed. There is routing, switching and many other functions which can be centrally managed in a cloud environment.

### Cloud Analytics

Data mining is a computing power extensive process, without a proper computer with enough RAM, ROM and some special drivers one cannot fully enjoy analyzing data. So to democratize data mining, a solution to power consumption was needed badly. Cloud analytics is a service where one or more components of an analytics setup is hosted in the clouds. There are many separate components of analytics namely, data sets, data models, computing power and processing software, and each of these component services can be easily managed in the cloud. The are a variety of choices if you want to perform some data mining in the cloud.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

## **Cost**

You don't need to buy hardware and running remote or on-site data centers. There's so much burden in running your own data center, the electricity, server, racks, cooling system and also the brainpower experts who do the everyday running of the servers. So cloud computing helps you achieve more without having to spend much on infrastructure.

### Performance

Cloud computing services are distributed over a worldwide network of data centers. The workload is done by a server nearby. Cloud computing providers have major data centers in almost every continent and when you signup for the services you can choose a data center nearby to reduce latency.

### Speed

A large amount of computing services (power) can be provisioned in seconds time and on demand. With high performance comes great speed improvements. You don't have to plan on capacity and scale.

### Reliability

Cloud providers are very reliable, and also the services such as storage and servers are well maintained by experts and always reliable.
