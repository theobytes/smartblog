Python is a **high level, interpreted** programming language released in 1991 by **[Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/)**. Python is a general purpose language meaning programmers can use it write softwares in various application domains. Since it's inception, developers and researchers have developed an avalanche of libraries and features for python and it has grown to be a very important programming language in industry and research places. Let's explore the history of python programming language and learn the philosophies behind it.

Guido van Rossum thought of an idea of a new programming language while working at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica](https://www.cwi.nl/) in 1980s. He wanted it to be successor to the [ABC programming language](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/abc/) with more advanced features like **error handling and to interface** with the [Amoeba operating system](https://www.cs.vu.nl/pub/amoeba/). Since he was also part of the team that developed ABC language, he incorporated the syntax features of it and some of it's good features. 

Guido started working on the python as a hobby project. He wanted to something to keep him occupied on holidays. He named the language Python from BBC’s TV Show ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’. Programmers a obsessed with short, elegant and weird names, so he wanted something short and interesting. Guido the python's project "benevolent dictator for life" up until 2018 when he stepped down from that role. 



## Python Philosophies (The Zen of Python)

* Explicit is better than implicit
* Simple is more
* Readable is key
* Beauty is better than ugly
* Special cases are not special enough to break the rules
